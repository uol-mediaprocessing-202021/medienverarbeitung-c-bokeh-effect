#### medienverarbeitung-c-bokeh-effect

Group C: Malte Trauernicht, Jona Schrader, Roman Kammer

**Goal:** 

Creating a program, that can load any picture to apply a simulated bokeh effect onto it, with an focus object as motive.
The program should be easy to use and understand for the common user but at the same time getting good result for most cases.

**Required Packages:**

Our implementation is based on Python3 with the following packages you need to install into your Python environment first to execute our program.

*Note:* Behind the installation commands are the versions we are using with our project.  

-pip3 install opencv-python (version 4.4.0)

-pip3 install numpy (1.19.4)

-pip3 install Pillow (8.1.0)

-pip3 install scikit-image (0.18.1)
